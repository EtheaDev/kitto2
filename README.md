Kitto<sup>2</sup> allows to create **Rich Internet Applications** based on a data model that can be mapped onto any database. The client-side part uses **ExtJS 6** (through webbroker technology) to create a fully **AJAX** application, allowing you to build standard and advanced data-manipulating forms in a fraction of the time.

The major differences of Kitto<sup>2</sup>, compared to the first version are:

- ExtPascal library has been removed
- Replacement of Apache + FastCGI with WebBroker technology.
- Replacement of ExtJS 3 with ExtJS 6

Kitto<sup>2</sup> is aimed at **Delphi** developers that need to create web or mobile applications without delving into the intricacies of HTML, CSS, Javascript or learning to use a particular library such as ExtJS6, yet it allows access to the bare metal if required.

Kitto<sup>2</sup> includes a **database-agnostic** data-access layer, allowing to create applications that work on any database engine and port applications between database engines.

A Kitto<sup>2</sup> application is described as a set of easily maintained **YAML** files, keeping definitions abstract and declarative and allowing for future extensions. Business rules are enforced either declaratively or through small javascript fragments on the client, or in Delphi code on the server.

Kitto<sup>2</sup> was designed by Nando Dessena and its development is sponsored by [Ethea](http://www.ethea.it/), which uses Kitto for internal development projects and client work and provides Kitto-related tools, support and development services.
